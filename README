The Swift UAV is a foot-launched tailless sailplane that was converted to an electric UAV.

I generated the aerodynamic [stability derivatives](StabilityReport/Swift_stability.pdf) used in the 6DOF simulation, and participated in the design of the avionics architecture for the Swift UAV.

This project was going to be my original PhD Thesis: building a sub-scale version of the aircraft in order to understand effects of scaling on the aerodynamic performance and dynamic response of sub-scale models. Feel free to read the [Research Proposal](ProjectProposal/SubScaleSwift.pdf)
